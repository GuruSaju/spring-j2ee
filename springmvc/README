When you're using Java code (as opposed to XML) to configure your Spring application, 
@EnableWebMvc is used to enable Spring MVC. 

@EnableWebMvc is equivalent to <mvc:annotation-driven /> in XML. It enables support 
for @Controller-annotated classes that use @RequestMapping to map incoming requests 
to a certain method.

GlobalExceptionHandler class with @controllerAdvice should be in the same package as 
Controller class
